Pokemon is a Nintendo video game where players create teams of virtual monsters that as of November 2017 has sold 301.5 million units. For my final project, I will be analyzing the spread of base pokemon statistics that make each pokemon unique in battle, allowing for a playable and competitive game. In my graph, I will spread their individual hitpoints, attack, special attack, defense, and special defense stats, in order to visually represent the patterns that make each Pokemon their own unique character. My graph is seperated by generation to allow competitive players a quick glance of how their Pokemon measures us up in each stat in each generation. Upon the final version of my app, a search feature will allow player to analyze the stats of a specific pokemon. In the dataset I am using there are 800 pokemon, all of which have unique statistical spreads to make the game balanced and competitive.
